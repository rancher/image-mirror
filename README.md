# Rancher Image Mirror

This repo is dedicated to mirroring images from other organizations to the
places they need to be for Rancher and its associated projects to use them.

## Overview

`regsync` is used for mirroring images from one repository to another. `regsync`
is configured via `regsync.yaml`. `regsync.yaml` is generated by running the
`generate-regsync` subcommand of the Go code in `tools/`, using `config.yaml` as
input. You can build the latest version of this code to `bin/image-mirror-tools`
using `scripts/build-tools.sh`. Thus, your workflow might look like this:
```
scripts/build-tools.sh
bin/image-mirror-tools generate-regsync
```
Once `regsync.yaml` has been updated, you may run `regsync` via the command
```
regsync once --verbosity error --config regsync.yaml --missing
```
`autoupdate.yaml` is used to configure automatic updates for images. When
an update is found, the automation creates a pull request that a human user
can then review and merge. See [`autoupdate.yaml`](#autoupdateyaml) for
more information.

### Adding New Images

When adding new images to the repo, please indicate so in the pull request.
You will need to submit a request to EIO, who will create the repo in
DockerHub. If this is not done, mirroring the image will fail. Nothing
special needs to be done for mirroring a new image to the Rancher Prime
registry.

### Image Prefixes

Every image that is mirrored by this repository should have a prefix that
communicates some information about it. The only exception is legacy images:
in the past the Rancher project did not add prefixes to mirrored images.
All new images must have a prefix.

| Prefix | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `mirrored-` | The image was mirrored from somewhere else. This is the default choice, and is used when the below prefixes do not apply.
| `appco-` | The image originated in the [SUSE Application Collection](https://apps.rancher.io/). We use images from the application collection because they have a better security posture.
| `hardened-` | The image has been hardened. This repository does not concern itself with hardened images.

## File Purpose/Structure

### `regsync.yaml`

`regsync.yaml` is mostly for use by `regsync`. It is generated from `config.yaml`,
and is not very easy to read. It should never be modified directly. It can,
however, be useful for checking that `config.yaml` changes will have the expected
effect on mirroring.

### `regsync-daily.yaml`

`regsync-daily.yaml` is a special case for images that must be mirrored daily.
Avoid using it if possible - it does not get you the benefits of using `config.yaml`
and `image-mirror-tools`. There should be a very good reason for using it, if you
do. `regsync-daily.yaml` is managed manually, and not touched by any automation.

As of the time of writing, `regsync-daily.yaml` is used only for Neuvector images.
The Neuvector images use it because the daily image builds incorporate the latest CVE
information. We must mirror the `latest` tag of these images each day for this
information to be available to users.

### `config.yaml`

#### `Repositories`

`Repositories` describes the repositories that image-mirror interfaces with.
This section roughly correlates to the `creds` section of `regsync.yaml`.

| Field | Required | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| `BaseUrl` | yes | The base URL for the repository. Appending `/` plus an image name should be a valid image reference.
| `Password` | yes | The password to use when authenticating against the registry. See [the regsync documentation](https://regclient.org/usage/regsync/) for more details.
| `Registry` | yes | The registry URL. See [the regsync documentation](https://regclient.org/usage/regsync/) for more details.
| `ReqConcurrent` | no | The number of concurrent requests that are made to this registry. See [the regsync documentation](https://regclient.org/usage/regsync/) for more details.
| `Target` | no | When `true`, denotes a target repository. This means that all images will be mirrored to this repository.
| `Username` | yes | The username to use when authenticating against the registry. See [the regsync documentation](https://regclient.org/usage/regsync/) for more details.

#### `Images`

`Images` describes the images that we want to mirror to each target
repository.

| Field | Required | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| `DoNotMirror` | no | Set to `true` to exclude the entire image from regsync.yaml. Alternatively, set to an array of strings to specify tags to exclude from regsync.yaml.
| `SourceImage` | yes | The source image. If there is no host, the image is assumed to be from Docker Hub.
| `Tags` | yes | The tags to mirror.
| `TargetImageName` | no | By default, the target image name is derived from the source image, and is of the format `mirrored-<org>-<name>`. For example, `banzaicloud/logging-operator` becomes `mirrored-banzaicloud-logging-operator`. However, there are some images that do not follow this convention - this field exists for these cases. New images should not set this field.

### `autoupdate.yaml`

`autoupdate.yaml` defines configuration for automatically updating image tags
based on various update strategies that monitor sources for new tags. Each
entry specifies a strategy for finding tags of images to potentially add to
`config.yaml`, which are then submitted as pull requests.

| Field           | Required | Description |
|-----------------| ------------- |------------- |
| `Name`          | yes | A unique identifier for this autoupdate entry. Used for logging and generating branch names for pull requests.
| `GithubRelease` | no | See [`GithubRelease`](#githubrelease).
| `HelmLatest`    | no | See [`HelmLatest`](#helmlatest).
| `Registry`      | no | See [`Registry`](#registry).
| `Reviewers`     | no | A list of GitHub users or teams to request review from on created pull requests. Teams should be in the format `org/team-slug`.

#### `GithubRelease`

The `GithubRelease` strategy fetches all release tags that matches the VersionConstraint from a GitHub
repository and applies it to the specified images.
If LatestOnly is true, it only fetches from the latest release and does not consider the VersionConstraint.

| Field               | Required | Description |
|---------------------|----------|------------- |
| `Owner`             | yes      | The GitHub repository owner/organization.
| `Repository`        | yes      | The GitHub repository name.
| `Images`            | yes      | See [`Images`](#images).
| `LatestOnly`        | no       | A flag to only fetch the latest github release.
| `VersionConstraint` | no       | A SemVer constraint used to filter the github releases.

##### `Images`

A list of images to be updated with the latest release tag. Each image will get the same tag as the GitHub release.

| Field | Required | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| `SourceImage` | yes | The GitHub repository name.
| `TargetImageName` | no | The TargetImageName of the image in `config.yaml` that you want to update.

#### `HelmLatest`

The `HelmLatest` strategy templates out the latest version of configured
Helm charts and extracts image references from the rendered manifests. It
recursively searches for fields with an "image" key in the templated YAML
output.

| Field | Required | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| `HelmRepo` | yes | The URL of the Helm chart repository.
| `Charts` | yes | A map where keys are the charts to template, and values are another map from environment name to lists of helm values to `--set` in that environment. `helm template` is run once for each environment.
| `Images` | no | Used to map a given update image to an entry in `config.yaml`. There may be multiple entries that have the same `SourceImage`, but different `TargetImageName`s, so we need to choose which one receives the update image.
| `ImageDenylist` | no | A list of images to exclude from the results.

#### `Registry`

The `Registry` strategy fetches all image tags that matches the `VersionFilter` from a registry defined in the Images provided.
Supported registries are:
* Suse Container Registry (registry.suse.com)
* Docker Hub
* Quay.io
* K8s registry (registry.k8s.io)
* GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
* Google Container Registry (gcr.io)

| Field           | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|------------- |
| `Images`        | yes      | Used to map a given update image to an entry in `config.yaml`. There may be multiple entries that have the same `SourceImage`, but different `TargetImageName`s, so we need to choose which one receives the update image.
| `Latest`        | no       | A flag to only use the latest tag. This only works if all tags are in semver format.
| `VersionFilter` | no       | A regex to match against the image tags fetched from the registry.
